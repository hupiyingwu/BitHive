## BitHive

Introducing blockchain-based script control

## Challenge

### User:

1.Most users don't like paying money for Apps

2.Users' privacy is monitored by trojans

3.The script will stop running when your computer shutdown

### Developer:
1.Developer are blackmailed by malware

2.Developer need to develop different versions of Apps for different OS

3.Expensive costs are required to maintain their servers
### Advertiser:
1.Targeting is poor,making users more likely to ignore ads

2.More than 6 million computers run ad-blocking

3.Bots inflicted $7.2 billion in fraud last year
## What is BitHive
# Open Sorce, Transparent,Decentralized
BitHive is a kind of Open sorce P2P script control.It's decentralized.The blockchains for everyone is independent,so you don't
 have to download all the blocks.Users only need to publish their IP address.Online nodes all over the 
world will supply computional power for your programs use to meet world-wide enterprise demand.You must tip the nodes 
who have ran your programs.
## Stage
### Stage 1:MEScript
The developer write MEScript and send the code to other nodes.
### Stage 2:Script control
Users set the hash of result and BitHive coins for tipping the online nodes who are working for them.
If a user is not the author,the script will be ran after it pays 10 BitHive coins to the author.
### Stage 3:BitHive explorer
The miners have to finish their work for getting BitHive coins. They might become users 
after they have BitHive coins and asking other nodes for running their programs.
## Why we need BitHive
### Users:
1.The script will still running after your computer shutdown.

2.BitHive can hide your IP address for protecting your privacy

3. All the Apps of BitHive had opened their sorce.They are safe.

4.You don't have to pay for Apps by dollars.just use BitHive coins.
### Developer:
1.Less costs are required to maintain your servers

2.You only need to input your commandfor a line to get online users all over the world

3.Your AI will finish your work when you are sleeping in bed
### Advertiser:
1.Users will more likely to read your ads carefully for getting BitHive coins

2.Sending a line of command is better than sending ads everywhere

3.Your ads won't be disappeared because of your blockchain
## Who controls the BitHive network
Nobody owns BitHive.BitHive is controled by the nodes all over the world.
Developers can make BitHive better.but they cannot change the protocol of BitHive,
because users can choose softwares which they like.
## How to keep one node is online at least
The total number of BitHive coins is 8000 for everyone.The way of getting BitHive coins
is becoming easier by mining.To get more BitHive coins,miners have to trade with others
by connecting BitHive network.
